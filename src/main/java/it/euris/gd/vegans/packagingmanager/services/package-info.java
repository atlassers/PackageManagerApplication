/**
 * This package contains all the SERVICEs and SERVICE IMPLEMENTATIONs used into the application.
 * Based on the folding strategy required by the project, we could
 * - group the interfaces *Service into the "service" folders, and their *ServiceImpl into the "impl"
 * subfolder
 * - group together *Service and *ServiceImpl into one folder, one for every services
 *
 * For this test we use the first strategy.
